# Galaban's Ship Stacker
This is a relatively simple plugin to stack the ships and display them in a much more readable, compact fashion.  This is for the Legends of the Jedi mud.

Commands:

    shipstacker            - Shows the help screen
    shipstacker <format>   - Sets the format for the output.  Options are 1, 2, or 3
    shipstacker enable     - Enables it, if you ever disable it
    shipstacker disable    - Disables it, obviously.  Kills the triggers, etc.


## To install
1. Download the raw file from github:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaban/LOTJShipStacker/master/Galabans_Ship_Stacker.xml
2. Place the raw file into your "plugins" directory.  This is found in your Mushclient folder under /worlds/plugins.
3. Install the plugain in MushClient.  From the "File" menu, choose "plugins", then "Add".  Select the file and choose "OK".

Note: If you do not already have the lotj_colors.lua file in your plugins directory, you will need that too.
